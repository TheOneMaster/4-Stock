# Start GG mobile app

Little project to improve my typescript and learn React. Also helps me understand mobile app development and GraphQL.

## Features implemented

- Tournament Search
- Basic Filtering for tournaments (name)
- Tournament Details
- Pages for event Details (results, brackets, etc)

## Features to be implemented

- Get better sorting for tournament search (check API for something I missed or message maintaners)
- Additional filtering options for tournaments (start/end dates, online/offline)
- Add proper location support (use Google dev API for maps)
- Brackets page currently only lists the sets present in the bracket. Change to display tree formatting when possible
