4 Stock is mobile UI for the website [start.gg](https://www.start.gg/). It's built using React native and expo which allows for cross compilation to both IOS and Android.

Obtains data from the start.gg public GraphQL API. However, user-login is still not supported by this API, so login is disabled on the app until it is finalized.
